# Predicting the direction of stock market prices using tree-based model

Machine learning techniques have recently become the norm for detecting patterns in financial markets.
The problem addressed in this work involves predicting the direction of stock price changes, specifically whether they will increase or decrease compared to the price n days prior.
To achieve this, we employ two algorithms, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted decision trees, which rely on decision tree ensembles. 
We evaluate our approach and report the testing performances for two technological stocks, demonstrating its superiority over existing prediction models.
